A Tookit for Aircraft Sizing and Synthesis in Matlab

A Toolkit for Aircraft Sizing and Synthesis (TASS), capable of performing sizing and syn-
thesis calculations for conceptual design of aircraft is developed in Matlab. 3 TASS implements
energy-based constraint and weight fraction approach for the mission sizing analyses. The per-
formance of TASS is benchmarked against the known metrics of a transonic jet fighter aircraft
F-86L Sabre (Sabrejet)

=================================================================================
This tool and documentation may, at times, sound more academic. It is indeed an academic project in one of my graduate courses. However, I have put my fullest possible effort to align it with interests of general readers and users i.e. sizing and synthesis of aircraft configurations, without compromising the academic deliverables.
