A Tookit for Aircraft Sizing and Synthesis in Matlab

A Toolkit for Aircraft Sizing and Synthesis (TASS), capable of performing sizing and syn-
thesis calculations for conceptual design of aircraft is developed in Matlab. 3 TASS implements
energy-based constraint and weight fraction approach for the mission sizing analyses. The per-
formance of TASS is benchmarked against the known metrics of a transonic jet fighter aircraft
F-86L Sabre (Sabrejet)
